Main Menu:
old school retro game music, kind of like 8 bit music style. It is for a pong game. Make it slow paced, but exciting like it is the menu for a grand new big adventure the player is about to embark on. It should be memorable. but it is also a modern twist for this game, so make some new modern overlays or effects. so overall retro game 8 bit style music, but with a small twist of modern gaming here and there. It is for the main menu of the game, so it is for representing, not for gameplay. 


Map music:
pixel game pong game game play music. it should not be over the top, but atmospheric music just to set the vibe. the music is only supporting very small, since there already are a bunch of sound effects. the music should be retro game 8 bit like, but atmospheric. quite, lowkey.
