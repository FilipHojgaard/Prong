old school retro game music, kind of like 8 bit music style. It is for a pong game. Make it slow paced, but exciting like it is the menu for a grand new big adventure the player is about to embark on. It should be memorable. but it is also a modern twist for this game, so make some new modern overlays or effects. so overall retro game 8 bit style music, but with a small twist of modern gaming here and there. It is for the main menu of the game, so it is for representing, not for gameplay.
